## Introduction
This comprehensive website has been designed for the University Research Group "Magnetic Soft Matter Group" of the University of Granada (Spain). 
It is designed to be responsive and accessible on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate for potential students and partners.
The purpose of the site is to create an online presence allowing researchers and students in general, to find out relevant information about the place, its main research releases, professors' background and events. 
"Magnetic Soft Matter Group" is a new international research group that operates in Granada (Spain) in the field of Bioengineering.
This is the second of four Milestone Projects that the developer must complete during their Full Stack Web Development Program at The Code Institute. 
The main requirement is to make an interactive front-end website using primarily **HTML5**, **CSS3** and **JavaScript**.

#### Strategy
Broken into three categories, the website will focus on the following target audiences:
The website will focus on the following target audiences:

- **Roles:**
   - Current students and researchers
   - Future students and researchers 
   - Stakeholders and interested entrepreneurs
- **Demographic:**
   - Post graduate students
   - PHDs and professors
   - Whoever is interested in this research area both for academic and business reasons

The website needs to enable the **User** to retrieve desired information, including:
- Information about current research
- Information about future research
- Information about the research group components and their qualifications
- Upcoming seminars/events
- Contact information (standard and social enquires)

The website needs to enable the **Research group** to:
- Develop an online presence 
- Provide an easily navigable website for users to find relevant information about:
  - New members/research
  - Provide a channel of communication for enquires (via the form or social media)
  - Provide a channel of communication for new and current stakeholders (Social Links - easily accessible throughout the site with a click)
  - Show the individual skills of each component of the unit and the overall competence of the group.

#### Scope
In order to identify what features had to be included, the scope was deifined based on the previously defined strategy. This was broken into two categories:

- **Content Requirements**
 - The user will be looking for:
  - General information
  - New features
  - Feedback
  - Contact details
  - Social links

- **Functionality Requirements**
 - The user will be able to:
   - Easily navigate through the site in order to find the information they want
 - Be able to find links to external sites in order to:
   - Verify the status of the place
   - Find directions
   - Be constantly updated about news
   - Contact the desired team members directly through the individual contact details or contact form

#### Structure
The information architecture was organized in a fluid and clear way in order to ensure that users could navigate through the site with ease and efficiency.
![Site Map](site_map_place_image_here)

#### Skeleton 
Wireframe mockups were created in a [Figma Workspace](place_compressed_figma_pdf_link_here).
The PDF file generated by Figma was too big to be loaded onto GitHub. I have compressed the file with Adobe Acrobat - Compress PDF and put it into a separate folder available for download or visualization in GitHub Desktop.
Several style changes were made in the final project compared to the inital wireframe on Figma. Those changes were mainly related to the choice of different pictures to better suit the new layout and Bootstrap features (e.g. xxxxxxxxxx), colours, font size, positioning on the page; all aimed at providing the best user experience and responsiveness.

**Pages:**
 1. Home Page:
![Home Page Wireframe](place_image_here "Home Page Wireframe")

 2. page
 ![xxxx Page Wireframe](place_image_here "xxxx Wireframe")

 3. page
  ![xxxx Page Wireframe](place_image_here "xxxx Wireframe")

 4. page
  ![xxxx Page Wireframe](place_image_here "xxxx Wireframe")

 5. page
  ![xxxx Page Wireframe](place_image_here "xxxx Wireframe")

### Surface

#### Colour Scheme
  - The main colours used throughout the website are a mixture of xxxxxxx (to represent the colour of xxxx), white (as a clear and non-invasive contrast colour to the previous one), and black fonts.

#### Typography
  -   The Oswald font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Nunito as the fallback font in case, for any reason, the font won't be imported into the site correctly.
  -   The Oswald font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Nunito as the fallback font in case, for any reason, the font will not be imported into the site correctly.

#### Imagery
  -   Imagery is extremely important in xxxxxx related websites. It is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. The carousel on the homepage is an immediate example of an element that catches the attention of the user with the most important features about the xxxxxx.
  - It also has a modern but classic aesthetic. The imagery has been thought about carefully to draw the attention of the user straight to the main components of the website.

## Features

### Design Features
Each page of the website features a consistent responsive navigational system:
- A responsive top **Banner** is positioned at the very beginning of the page entirely for aesthetic reasons.
- The **Header** contains a conventionally placed **logo** at the top left of the page (clicking this will redirect users back to the home page) and **navigation bar** at the top right of the page.
- On smaller screens, the navigation bar collapses into a **toggler** icon whereby clicking it will reveal the navigation and social media links.
- On larger screens, the **Footer** contains the appropriate **social media icons**, linking users to the main social media pages of the research group.
- In the footer, there is a mailto action above the email.
- <li><strong>xxxxx</strong> - Those <strong>call to action</strong> buttons are present at least once on every page,so that the users are prone to clicking.
</li>
<dl>
  <dt><a href="index.html" target="_blank" alt="Pasta & Vino Home Page">Home Page</a></dt>
  <dd>The Home Page consists of the following elements:
     <ul>
          <li><strong>Hero Image/carousel</strong> - Occupies 100% of the page width, from the left to the right, while being viewed on all devices. The imagery used was specifically chosen as it created an impactful first impression of the winebar/ restaurant with inspiring images, establishing user expectations for what comes next.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Card list</strong> - Occupies 80% of the page width, from left to right, while being viewed on a desktop. On mobile and tablet devices, the card list responsively positions vertically, underneath the <strong>Carousel</strong>. The purpose of the card list is to provide an area in the center to highlight the three main features of the restaurant. This style was chosen in order to draw the users' attention to the information straight away. In this, there is a <strong>call to action</strong> button which links to the external page where users are invited to check out the impressive wine/spirits list, one of the main features of the winebar/ restaurant.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Feedback</strong> - Positive <strong>reviews</strong> are positioned just below the card list to increase trust in the user.
          </li>
     </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt><a href="xxxx.html" target="_blank" alt="xxxx Page">Menu Page</a></dt>
  <dd>The xxxx page consists of the following elements:
     <ul>
          <li><strong>Card list</strong> - Occupying about 80% of the page, this comprehensive card list shows the main and most popular dishes of the restaurant. It starts with appetizers and ends with desserts.
          Once again, in the wine section of the page a <strong>call to action</strong> button is present, which redirects the user to an external PDF page with the wine/spirits menu.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Notices</strong> - At the end of the page there is a list of important information about rules and regulations about the locale.
          </li>
     </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt><a href="xxxx.html" target="_blank" alt="xxxx Page">Gallery Page</a></dt>
  <dd>The Gallery page consists of the following elements:
     <ul>
          <li><strong>Collage</strong> - Occupying about 50% of the page, this impressive and resposive gallery has the goal of showing the place in a way that catches the user's attention. The images have an ease-in-out effect in order to be more interesting and fun. Furthermore, every time the user hovers over the images, the name of the restaurant appears in a way that is not invasive but effective.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Google Maps</strong> - iframe embedding of Google maps shows the location of the restaurant. The map is responsive in smaller devices.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Youtube Video</strong> - iframe embedding of a Youtube video showing a chef plating up. Once again, an element intended to catch the user's attention and increase curiosity.
          </li>
     </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt><a href="xxxx.html" target="_blank" alt="xxxx Page">About Us</a></dt>
  <dd>The About Us page consists of the following elements:
     <ul>
          <li><strong>Main Image</strong> - A catchy image designed to capture the attention of the user about a feature of the xxxx and to draw the eye to the following element.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Our Driving Force</strong> - Two cards positioned next to each other with a description of the two main protagonists of the restaurant. This part is for the users who want to know more about the two people who represent the strong points of the restaurant and its success.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Second Main Image</strong> - Catchy image designed to capture the attention of the user about a feature of the restaurant (main dining area) and as a sort of separation from the following element.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Form</strong> - A standard form for the users who want to subscribe.
          </li>
     </ul>
  </dd>
  </dl>

## Issues and Bugs 
The developer ran into a number of issues during the development of the pages.
The guiding approach in developing the website was the motto: "Mobile First". This aims to create better experiences for users by starting the design process from the smallest of screens: a mobile.
**Navbar issue** - An initial issue was to position the navbar links aligned to the logo. This was resolved with a few trials on where to position the right div.
**Social Links Bug** - A bug was found when testing the social media links. It would not redirect to the right page, giving an error message. It has been resolved by inserting a more complete URL.
**Gallery Issue** - A great amount of time was dedicated to finding the most suitable style for a gallery that could be both responsive and aesthetically pleasing. After many trials with Bootstrap and other solutions, the best approach was that of a gallery made with CSS Media Queries.
**Iframe Bug** - An iframe related bug was found when reducing the screen size. Google Maps iframe was not responsive in smaller devices and overflowed the screen. It was resolved using the Bootstrap classes as with the Youtube iframe.
**HTML Validator-related resolved bugs**
